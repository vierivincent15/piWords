Finding English Words in the Digits of Pi

## Tasks
The theme of this project is to find English words in the digits of Pi. To do this, we'll:
1. Compute the fractional digits of Pi
2. Convert the digits of Pi into a numeric base more suitable for word-finding -- i.e., base 26.
3. Transform the digits of Pi into an alphabetic String of letters
4. Find words in that particular encoding of Pi

After the basic version of the code works, we'll work on improving it to get better word coverage -- changing the mapping of digits to letters so that you're more likely to find interesting words.

Your workflow for this problem set should be:
1. Carefully look at the specification of the method you are looking to implement. The specifications are written as comments in the starting code.
2. Write the actual method we specified.
